Problem Statement: Dynamic Word Typer
Create a dynamic word typer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays a series of words with a typing effect. The application should meet the following requirements:


Create an array of words: ['Love', 'Jhakaas', 'mast', 'Weird']
Implement a typing effect that displays each word from the array one at a time in the <span class="typed-text"></span> element.
Each letter of a word should appear after a 1000ms delay.
Delete each letter of the word with a 1000ms delay between each letter.
After a word is fully deleted, move to the next word in the array and repeat the process.
The typing effect should loop through the array indefinitely.
